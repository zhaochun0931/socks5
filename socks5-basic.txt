SOCKS5 is the most recently optimized version of SOCKS, an internet protocol that tunnels web traffic through a remote server. 
The SOCKS5 protocol builds upon previous versions of the SOCKS proxy protocol to offer advanced security through multiple authentication methods. 
This means that only authorized users can access SOCKS5 proxy servers.
