ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N username@remote-server-ip



Explanation of the flags:

-D 1080: Tells SSH to set up a SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080 on your local machine.
-f: Tells SSH to run in the background.
-C: Compresses data during transmission (optional but can help speed up the connection).
-q: Reduces the verbosity of SSH output.
-N: Tells SSH not to execute any commands, just establish the tunnel.
