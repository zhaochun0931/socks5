SSH should be installed on both the client (your Ubuntu machine) and the remote server.






Create the SOCKS5 Proxy Tunnel:



ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N username@remote-server-ip



Explanation of the flags:

-D 1080: Tells SSH to set up a SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080 on your local machine.
-f: Tells SSH to run in the background.
-C: Compresses data during transmission (optional but can help speed up the connection).
-q: Reduces the verbosity of SSH output.
-N: Tells SSH not to execute any commands, just establish the tunnel.






Configure your application or system to use the SOCKS5 proxy: 

Now that youâ€™ve created the tunnel, you need to configure the application (e.g., browser, terminal, etc.) to use the SOCKS5 proxy at localhost:1080.







Verify the Connection: 

You can verify that the proxy is working by checking your IP address via websites like https://www.whatismyip.com or by using curl:

curl --proxy socks5h://localhost:1080 https://httpbin.org/ip
